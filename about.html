                <p style="width: 500px; margin-right: 0;">Hello, Internet user, you just met a real person, in which she looks really not like an ordinary actor as in other works about Runal - and it's me! The creator about my young girl.
                    <br>I just want to tell you information about me:
                    <br>I am a Russian musician, and an artist of my works. And sometimes I often admire the country of Japan and studied it.
                    Also with my personalities I am a biologist and a chemist(in the future), and being alone in the world, because in my homeland I do not meet anyone, and I feel self-care and self-confident.
                    <br>I like to create all sorts of things like horrors. And I study with my hobbies.</p>
                    <p style="width: 500px; margin-right: 0;">Probably this is all that I told about myself... But thank you for reading my information about me, and I am grateful to you that you look at my other works, according to which I am still just learning and striving with this.</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">- With respect,<br>Kris B.</p>
